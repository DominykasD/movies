## Info
MongoDB - NoSQL database in which data is stored in documents that consist of key-value pairs, sharing a lot of resemblance to JSON.

Express - flexible and clean Node.js web application framework. 

React - an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. React lets you build complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML.

NodeJS - a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. NodeJS allows us to write our backend in JavaScript. 

Redux - open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.
